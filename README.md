# Biosignature AI Project

This project uses AI to analyze genomic adaptations of extremophiles and planetary data to predict potential biosignatures on exoplanets.

## Goals
- Collect and process genome data of extremophiles
- Analyze planetary environments from NASA datasets
- Train AI models to identify survivability markers
- Predict which exoplanets may host life

## Tools
- Python, PyTorch, BioPython, Astropy
- Google Colab for notebooks
- GitHub for version control

## Structure
- `/notebooks`: Colab notebooks for experiments
- `/data`: Scripts to fetch and process data
- `/models`: Trained models and weights
- `/utils`: Helper scripts and feature engineering
